I first started writing Python in 2009, in my first Github repo: [sudoku-solver](https://github.com/audiodude/sudoku-solver), an open source library for solving Sudoku puzzles that I did in my free time (I had a lot of free time back then because I was unemployed and living in my parents' basement).

Soon after I got my job at [[Qwobl]] with Jawad and [[Christian]] and Joe, where I wrote a lot more Python code. I don't think they ever told me this, but I think they looked at the sudoku code when considering me for the job.

Python has remained one of my favorite programming languages. I would say I'm probably slightly more proficient in it than [[javascript-typescript|Javascript/Typescript]], which is what I use for my [[YouTube|day job]].

At one point, I figured out a way to [[warnings-python|elevate Python warnings]] to errors in order to help debug and fix them.

In 2023 I started teaching a completely free [Python class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) at [Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/). It has since evolved into a more general  ["Computer Programming Study Group"](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Computer_Programming_Study_Group), but we still cover some of the Python lectures from time to time. The lectures I wrote are in the Noisebridge [GitHub repo](https://github.com/noisebridge/PythonClass) for the class. Here's a list, with a link to interactive copies of the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on a [Littlest Jupyter Hub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/) instance that I host. **If you'd like the password for sfpythonlab.com, email me and introduce yourself.**
