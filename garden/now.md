Tough couple of weeks recently, as my wife was inpatient in the hospital. She was getting a scheduled pain treatment, so no cause for alarm, but it was still stressful. When she got out she also started having some bad migraines, so we've been dealing with that.

I got my first [PR for Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/26910) merged! It's something I really believe in.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy, rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

The [Python class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) that I was teaching at [Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) on Monday nights has evolved into a ["Computer Programming Study Group"](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Computer_Programming_Study_Group). I was wondering what I would do for the next "iteration" of the class, and I'm trying to open it up to more topics and have less structure. It's been going ok, I'm still teaching some of the Python lectures every now and then, and I'm trying to develop some JavaScript lectures.

I quit my D&D group, because I didn't really have the time for it unfortunately. The people I played with were really nice though.

As far as video games, I finally sat down and finished [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) even though the ending had been spoiled for me a long time ago. What a cool clicker game! I've been given a recommendation for [Antimatter Dimensions](https://ivark.github.io/AntimatterDimensions/) for my next clicker game, which is considered one of the best of all time. I'm still eyeing New World Aeterneum, because I've always been (sadly) more of a "solo" MMO player, and never had big or small groups that I was consistently a part of. And of course, Factorio Space Age is coming out in October!

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
