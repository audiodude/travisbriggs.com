The main news right now is that [[Abby]] is going to be starting a chemotherapy
drug in the next few months that will hopefully shrink some of her tumors.
She'll be on it for at least 18 months and there's a lot of potential side
effects, so I have a lot of anxiety, but also hope.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived
in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy,
rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the
same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

I'm still teaching a free [Python
class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) at
[Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) on Monday nights. I'm trying a new format
where I intentionally repeat lessons several times, in order to give people a
chance to catch up when they miss classes (which people tend to do a lot) and
also reinforce material that may have been mystifying the first time around.
I've also been experimenting with
[recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XALGw2P4Ac) the lessons.

All the work I put into [Rainfall](https://rainfall.dev) has kind of been a
bust. I added [matomo analytics](https://matomo.org/) and it seems like I'm
getting between 1-3 visits a week. Yikes. Not sure if I want to ramp up some
efforts to promote the thing, or just let it die a quiet death. Meanwhile,
[Faircamp](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/), which Rainfall is based on, got
some new features and it seems like a good time to support those features, so I
have _some_ amount of inspiration to continue development.

I bought a beautiful used copy of _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_ from Dog Eared
Books and I'm definitely enjoying it. I also took out another Zen book from the
library, about zazen and Zen meditation. Both books emphasize that there's kind
of no point in "reading about Zen" and that the real value is from the practice
of sitting zazen. So I'm thinking about going to the beginner day at the [San
Francisco Zen Center](https://sfzc.org) (which is the sangha founded by Shunryu
Suzuki, the author of the book) on April 6. It's walking distance from my
apartment!

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead
of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a
friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that
directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
