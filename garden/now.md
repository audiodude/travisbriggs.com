YouTube (and I think Google in general) has called all fully remote workers back
into the office starting in September. It will be a hybrid schedule, the same as
everyone else, Tuesday through Thursday in the office. In preparing for this, we
bought a new car, a 2025 Toyota RAV4, black. I'm excited to have a car for a
number of reasons, but I'm not terribly excited to have to street park it.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived
in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy,
rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the
same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

I'm still teaching a free [Python
class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) at
[Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) on Monday nights. The new format of
repeating each lesson several times has been going well! I've also been
experimenting with
[recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XALGw2P4Ac&list=PLFfm7ymJs-GxWVuqKVt8Ge2TjHNFJHcGt)
the lessons.

I've also got a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
intern with [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/en/), working on [[wp-1.0|WP1]]. It's been
going well so far, the student is very capable and engaged.

I've kind of gone down a "audiophile"/high fidelity rabbit hole. I subscribed to
[Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/discover) and although I'm not fully
conviced I can tell the difference between 320kbps MP3 and CD quality, I bought
a high definition DAC that plugs into my laptop and iPad, and a new set of high
quality Beyerdynamic headphones. It's certainly made my music listening less
convenient!

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead
of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a
friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that
directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
