I just celebrated my 10th wedding anniversary with a trip to the Madonna Inn in
San Luis Obispo. It was very lovely, including the 4 hour drive each way which
was actually nice, because Abby and I like to go on road trips together.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived
in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy,
rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the
same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

I'm still teaching a free [Python
class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) at
[Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) on Monday nights. We're a couple of weeks
into series 4. The first class was very well attended, though there have been
some hiccups in the ensuing weeks.

I've been putting some time into
[mwoffliner](https://github.com/openzim/mwoffliner), the software that scrapes
Mediawiki sites (like Wikipedia) to create offline ZIM files. I've also done a
lot of work on [Rainfall](https://rainfall.dev), including implementing 1-click
deploy to Netlify.

For reading, I'm a couple of chapters into a couple of non-fiction books, and a
couple of fiction books as well. Sigh.

As far as video games, I've been playing dozens of hours of Factorio Space Age
now that it's been released. Stil haven't gotten off Nauvis yet though.

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead
of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a
friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that
directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
