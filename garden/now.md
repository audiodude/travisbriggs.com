[[Abby]] will be having surgery on tumors in the back of her scalp on April 29.
She's currently visiting her family in Massachusetts, though I might fly out
this coming monday (Apr 21) to meet them in New York City. She's also going to
be starting a chemotherapy drug in the next few months that will hopefully
shrink some of her other tumors. We have a lot of anxiety but also a lot of
hope.

I checked out the [San Francisco Zen Center](https://sfzc.org) on April 6. It
is, in fact, walking distance from my apartment! Of course now I'm kind of
obsessed with Zen, which is literally ironic. The more you grasp at it, the more
it slips through your fingers and all that.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived
in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy,
rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the
same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

I'm still teaching a free [Python
class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) at
[Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) on Monday nights. The new format of
repeating each lesson several times has been going well! I've also been
experimenting with
[recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XALGw2P4Ac&list=PLFfm7ymJs-GxWVuqKVt8Ge2TjHNFJHcGt)
the lessons.

Someone reached out about a bug in [Rainfall](https://rainfall.dev) but it seems
to have resolved itself? Meanwhile, [Faircamp](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/),
which Rainfall is based on, got some new features and it seems like a good time
to support those features, so I have _some_ amount of inspiration to continue
development. I'm still secretly hoping that it goes viral and gets popular or
something, especially considering all the work I put into specifically making it
scalable.

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead
of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a
friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that
directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
