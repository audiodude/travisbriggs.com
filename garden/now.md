YouTube (and I think Google in general) has called all fully remote workers back
into the office starting in <strikethrough>September</strikethrough> October. It
will be a hybrid schedule, the same as everyone else, Tuesday through Thursday
in the office. In preparing for this, we bought a new car, a 2025 Toyota RAV4,
black. I'm excited to have a car for a number of reasons, but I'm not terribly
excited to have to street park it. Or drive it to work for that matter.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived
in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy,
rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the
same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

My friends at [Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) encouraged me to resume my
free [Python class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) in September. Well
it's September, and I haven't resumed it. I'm not sure I will. I just don't feel
particularly confident in Noisebridge as an institution to justify investing my
effort there anymore.

My [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) intern with
[Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/en/) finished his project successfully! He worked on
[[wp-1.0|WP1]] and you can read his final writeup [in his own
words](https://gist.github.com/nicolapace/822fc72fa1e438c1fb3848043347f9ce).

My friend Will got married in Philadelphia! I was part of the unofficial
official wedding party and we all looked great and had a great time. I cried
during the ceremony quite a bit and cursed myself for not bringing tissues.

I've taken on a paid tutoring gig for a coworker's son, and I offered to tutor
the brother of my friend's new wife, who I talked to at the wedding.

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead
of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a
friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that
directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
