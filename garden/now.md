I can't believe January is almost over already! I've started doing morning pages
again at the new [750words.com](https://750words.com), so we'll see how long
that lasts. I celebrated Wikipedia's birthday at [Wikipedia
day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Day) last weekend. And I
had an awful time with my doctor's office about getting some controlled meds
refilled.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived
in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy,
rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the
same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

I'm still teaching a free [Python
class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) at
[Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) on Monday nights. It's been over a month
since I taught a class (the class on my birthday was covered by soeone else), so
I'm excited to get back into it this Monday.

I've been putting some time into
[mwoffliner](https://github.com/openzim/mwoffliner), the software that scrapes
Mediawiki sites (like Wikipedia) to create offline ZIM files. I've also done a
lot of work on [Rainfall](https://rainfall.dev), most of which was changing the
architecture significantly so that it can properly scale, in case it ever gets
thousands of users. My thought is that I wouldn't want to put all this work into
it, and then it suddenly hits the front page of [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and breaks and I have no chance to fix it.

For reading, I'm a couple of chapters into a couple of non-fiction books, and a
couple of fiction books as well. Sigh.

As far as video games, I'm still focusing on Factorio Space Age, but I kind of
took a break after the holidays. I've also started a Pokémon Sapphire game,
though I've never successfully "beaten" any Pokémon game.

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead
of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a
friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that
directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
