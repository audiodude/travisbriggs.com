I'm officially back in the office at YouTube. So far the commute has been fine,
but being stuck at a desk all day with no option to take breaks and chat with
[[Abby|my wife]] has been kind of a bummer. I made a joke on the second day to
my boss that "I don't know office etiquette anymore, I need to be
re-socialized!" and I think that actually might be kind of true.

I've been officially elected Secretary of BAWUG, the [Bay Area Wikipedians User
Group](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Wikipedians_User_Group)!
Practically speaking, I was part of the only slate of candidates that there was,
and what it really means is just making official the duties I was already
volunteering for. But it's exciting! We had a successful event at SFPL North
Beach branch on Oct 7.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived
in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy,
rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the
same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

I'm pretty confident that I won't be resuming my free [Python
class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) at this point. Just kind of
feel like I've disengaged from [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net) and the
ship has sailed.

My friend Will, soon after getting married, has moved back to Berlin with his
new bride. Now, I barely saw him when he was in LA, but really the big problem
with this move, from my perspective, is the time zone difference.

My "meds" are currently being adjusted, so just...be gentle with me. Have you
ever heard of [anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia)? I wouldn't
recommend it.

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead
of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a
friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that
directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
