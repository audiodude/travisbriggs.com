I just got back from Switzerland where I did a week long hackathon/conference with my friends from [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/). I've volunteered with them since 2017 on the [[wp1-1.0|WP 1.0 bot]] and some offline Wikipedia activities.

Currently, I'm still living in San Francisco, in the same apartment I've lived in since we moved there in December 2012. What can I say, it's cozy, rent-controlled and in an awesome neighborhood (near Zeitgeist). I also have the same job at YouTube that I've had all that time.

I've been teaching a free [Python class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass) ([github](https://github.com/audiodude/PythonClass)) at [Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net/) on Monday nights. It's difficult and interesting to give the lectures, which I've been writing myself from scratch. There's a good number of people (5-8) that are coming on a regular basis so that's encouraging.

I'm playing D&D again, as of August 2023! I've got a fun group of 5 players and one DM who have varying levels of experience and a lot of enthusiasm. I'm playing a Bard, my favorite class.

I've been playing [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) and watching the [Fallout TV series](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(American_TV_series)>). I've also been going to Alamo Drafthouse a lot with my wife, who has a "season pass" type thing where we both get free tickets once a day (doesn't help with food costs though!). I started a [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/audiodude/) account but I've been bad about adding reviews (go figure).

### What is a 'now' page?

A now page is like an [[about]] page, but with the scope of "right now" instead of a long view. The easiest way to think about it is: what would you tell a friend that you haven't seen in a while about what you're up to?

### Where can I find a list of people with websites that feature a 'now' page?

Just go to [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com). You can add your site to that directory should you choose to add a /now page to your site.
