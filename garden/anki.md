 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an open source program for viewing and drilling flashcards. It also operates as a cloud service that provides pre-existing flashcard "decks" and the ability to sync your progress across devices. So you can view flashcards on your phone, or on your computer and keep everything up to date.

The most recent flashcards I've downloaded are for [[spanish|Spanish]], but I haven't really looked at them yet.

The last time I opened Anki I did find my old "capitals and countries of the world" deck that I had been meaning to work through. I had previously done US states and capitals to great success, but the countries of the world deck was a lot harder to stick with. Part of the problem I had was that there were too many "cards". What I realized was that Anki generates cards based on inputting "notes" (which are collections of facts) and running them through "templates". So I simply had to create an alternate set of templates for my world countries and capitals deck, and I could weed out some of the more tedious cards (things like, "Where on a map is this country's capital?" and "What city in &lt;country&gt; is this?". For the latter, the answer was always the capital and it was a bit overkill).
