When I first started reading about Digital Gardens, I quickly came to the conclusion that I wanted one for myself. I really just wanted to break out of the prison of creating perfectly polished and self-contained "blog posts" that existed in [[dg-reverse|reverse chronological order]].

I have tried to live up to the [[digital-gardening-principles|digital gardening principles]] that I laid out for myself early on, with varying degrees of success.

This garden is also available as a [[gemini|Gemini]] capsule at [gemini://gem.travisbriggs.com](gemini://gem.travisbriggs.com).

The source code for this garden is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com), and I'm tracking [issues to improve it](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues). It is based on [Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) which is based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

There's always a temptation to just re-write the software for the whole thing, following the natural [[blog-cycle|blog cycle]].
