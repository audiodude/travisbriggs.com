I don't have a ton of opinions on philosophy. I consider myself something of an existentialist, because I believe that life and existence are absurd and without inherent meaning. We must create our own meaning. However most days it's hard for me to actually picture [Sisyphus happy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus).

I don't believe in free will. I am a determinist. I believe there is plenty of evidence that "free will" is the name we give to the process by which our conscious mind explains to itself why it did something.

I'm also an [[atheism|atheist]], which probably deserves its own article.

It's hard to write a garden node title "philosophy", which exists in the abstract without any particular object that the supposed philosophy is focused on. Relatedly, I've started getting interested in [[Zen]] again. In one of the books I was reading about Zen, the author discussed how it's impossible to picture an object without a subject. I think this page is kind of a testament to that.

At some points in time I've described myself as an "Atheistic Taoist". Anyways, this is the philosophy node, not the religion node. But I think I need to take more inspiration from Wikipedia, where yes, [Everything In Its Right Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onRk0sjSgFU), but also it's okay if there's some redundant information here and there, if it helps explain and clarify things. And especially, in the case of this digital garden, if it adds flavor or character or I just, you know, feel like doing it!
