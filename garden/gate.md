_I'm trying desperately to resist the urge to write this entire website as a choose-your-own adventure game. Must, resist._

As you enter the garden, you can see a bunch of [[best albums in the universe|records]] for sale, or at least on display. You also hear [[danger-third-rail|a band]] playing somewhere inside. It's impossible to miss the huge amount of power extension cords and other wires darting through the gate, laying on the ground, and even going up over the walls of the garden. Whatever is going on here requires plenty of electricity it would seem.

You also see what looks like a disheveled madman rambling to himself about [[blog|blogging]].

There's a live digital display telling you about things that are going on right [[now]].

A [[writings|scrappy-looking journal]] is open on a simple table, with some handwritten poetry and the like. 

In the corner of the garden, there is a large smelly [[compost|compost pile]].

If you pick up the entire garden and flip it around (how did you do _that_?!?), you can read some of the [[plans]] for the thing.
