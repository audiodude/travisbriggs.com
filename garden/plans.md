Here I'd like to discuss some of my plans, hopes, aspirations and whatnot for this digital garden. I've documented some of the more [technical issues](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues) on the garden's [Github repo](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com). But I guess what I want to do here is talk more about what I plan to write about, how I plan to organize things.

I'm trying to do all this in accordance with my interpretation of the [[digital-gardening-principles|Digital gardening principles]].

Yes, I know I should have comments ([#13!](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues/13))

I did recently start a [[til|TIL (Today I Learned)]] section of the garden, and I'm interested in keeping that up to date. But it's maybe just another random assortment of reverse-chronological links (boo!). Also, one of the first things I did when I started the garden was to import all of my recent [[blog|blog posts]] from write.as. Oh no, more reverse-chronological links!

I'm thinking that the real goal should be to somehow "absorb" the content in those blog posts into more organic topic pages. Some of them, like [[blog/what-programming-language-should-i-learn|"What programming language should I learn?"]] lend themselves nicely to that. But others, where I'm just [[blog/latest-and-not-so-greatest|randomly complaining about music production]] or something, I'm not sure how to work them in. Maybe that's the fun!

The real problem with "Today I Learned" is that I haven't been able to identify and write about something I've learned every day. On the other hand, I don't think I need to force myself to "crank out" content to keep my garden full. I think the spirit of the thing is that it grows organically, like a real garden.

Also I've been suddenly tempted to write "blog" type articles as dubious TIL, where there's no obvious things I learned. I think I'm devolving to reverse-chronological faster than previously feared.

I definitely already have a bunch of "Stub" and "Start" quality articles that I could expand upon. Not sure what exactly to do there other than simply write a Wikipedia article on the topic (like [[DistroKid]]). I read in Andy Matuschak's "Evergreen Notes" that [Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C&stackedNotes=z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF) which I think I'm not exactly following, because I've developed lots of garden "nodes" that are nouns.

Also Andy says that [Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C&stackedNotes=z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF&stackedNotes=z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC) which I knew intuitively, but I hadn't really been following. I think I need to actively seek out and link together my nodes (and no, I'm not going to belabor the analogy and start calling them "plants" or "seeds").

Also, I'm still working on the [[gemini|Gemini]] port of this garden. It's much, much more complicated than I thought it would be.
