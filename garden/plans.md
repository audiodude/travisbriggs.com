Here I'd like to discuss some of my plans, hopes, aspirations and whatnot for this digital garden. I've documented some of the more [technical issues](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues) on the garden's [Github repo](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com). But I guess what I want to do here is talk more about what I plan to write about, how I plan to organize things.

I'm trying to do all this in accordance with my interpretation of the [[digital-gardening-principles|digital gardening principles]].

I added a [[now]] page, which I think is some kind of progress. Now (see what I did there?) I need to make sure I keep it updated. That's the struggle in general with this garden, is that if I don't have something new to say or some idea to convey, I don't spend much time "tending" it. So far, my [[compost|compost pile]] is a good step in the direction of eschewing [[dg-reverse|reverse chronilogical links]] at least.

I still want to move the content in my blog posts into more organic topic pages. Some of them, like [[blog/what-programming-language-should-i-learn|"What programming language should I learn?"]] lend themselves nicely to that. But others, where I'm just [[blog/latest-and-not-so-greatest|randomly complaining about music production]] or something, I'm not sure how to work them in. Maybe that's the fun!

I think the spirit of the thing is that it grows organically, like a real garden.

I definitely already have a bunch of "Stub" and "Start" quality articles that I could expand upon. Not sure what exactly to do there other than simply write a Wikipedia article on the topic (like [[DistroKid]]). I read in Andy Matuschak's "Evergreen Notes" that [Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C&stackedNotes=z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF) which I think I'm not exactly following, because I've developed lots of garden "nodes" that are nouns.

Also Andy says that [Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C&stackedNotes=z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF&stackedNotes=z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC) which I knew intuitively, but I hadn't really been following. I think I need to actively seek out and link together my nodes (and no, I'm not going to belabor the analogy and start calling them "plants" or "seeds").
