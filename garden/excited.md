Here are some things I'm either currently excited about, or at least I was excited about when I wrote about them.

Okay, this is now over two years old, and I'm not sure aything has come of it. But I felt really inspired when I read Robin Sloan's excellent [newsletter post](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/) about "A Year of New Avenues". It is hopelessly exuberant and optimistic, and in that way extremely intoxicating. It also challenges the reader, especially in the span of prompting for "new avenues" for 2023 but at the same time gently chastising that "Mastodon is not it".

In my internet travels, I've been looking at [[gemini|Gemini]] as a protocol that could be useful for building something in the whale corpse of Facebook and Twitter.

I've also heard of [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/) a few years back, around the time I was first learning about Mastodon. It seems much more quirky, experimental and revolutionary than Mastodon will ever be. Especially with it's focus on offline social networks (did you even know there was such a thing?).

I always have a nagging desire to learn [[spanish|Spanish]], but I'm not sure it will ever translate into real motivation and action.
