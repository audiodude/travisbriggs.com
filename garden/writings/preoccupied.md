The poet, it seemed,  
was preoccupied with death and  
wrote poems, fiercely stripped  
of other intentions and inquiries,  
which invited those readers who,  
with naive aims and scarcely guarded dispositions,  
were invited into the harsh yet peaceful  
embrace of the same.  
He (the poet) related dearly  
to these grim works,  
flowing furiously and free from  
the heart of his past disappointments and  
future anxieties.  
Why, the pale beast such a  
sweet seductress surface?  
Why dwell on ultimate demise?  
Why let the fragrant afternoon  
pass, unexamined, into the abyss  
of lost Saturdays and holidays  
which served only to taunt the  
faculties of his reason and  
twist the object of his imagination  
towards the bitter machinations of   
Death itself?
