They said to practice my  
coping skills.  
This is a submission of optimism.  
An acknowledgement that  
Not everything is OK  
Not everything can be fixed.  
It's a glorious recognition that  
pain is real.  
I don't need to be defeated by it.  
Seeing it  
Knowing it  
Feeling it  
Is the first step to  
resilience.
