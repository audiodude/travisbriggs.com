These are the days.  
The days when you have to show up,  
Abandon the sad little pout on your face,  
Take a deep breath,  
Give yourself a quick pep talk,  
And get that shit done.

These are the days.  
The days when people don't care about your excuses,  
Or your past successes.  
When all that matters is today, the now,  
When you have one job, just one,  
And you better get it done.

These are the days.  
The cloudy, damp, overcast grays,  
The nine to five that's put you in a haze,  
You need a deep breath to figure out the ways,  
To kick doubt to the curb while confidence stays.  
A little pep talk to help you  
Get it done.

These are the days that make up our lives. And if we don't do the things we want to do, make the things we want to make, and love the people we want to love on these days, there will be no other time for any of it.
