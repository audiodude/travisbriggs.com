The rainy and gray  
Of this late summer day  
Fits my mood   
Quite well, actually, and it makes me  
Smile in the fullness of its melancholy.  
Delicious melancholy that you can bite right  
Into, and get a juicy mouthful. The un-joy  
Drips off your chin. It's satisfying to know  
That the world, the weather, the movement of  
The goddamn oceans are all in agreement that  
Today is not an exuberant day. Today is a day  
For some healthy, hearty wallowing and maybe  
A smidge of reflection on what it's like to  
Be me.
