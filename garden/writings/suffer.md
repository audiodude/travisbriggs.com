Why do I suffer the days  
To cause me such anguish?  
Press the hot iron of torture, they do,  
As the spectre of the day's tasks,  
Unfinished,  
Flit into the orange flames of another dusk.  
Her features refuse to soften  
As she scolds,  
"Why don't you read a book?  
Why don't you play a game?  
Why don't you watch television with me?  
Why don't you do any number of things  
That would distract you from the  
Gnawing tug of disappointment you always feel  
Around this time of evening?"  
But how can I be bothered  
To ease the burden brought only on myself  
By myself?  
Why would I shrink back  
From the agony of songs unwritten  
And poems unsung which  
Cleave their hooks into my brain  
And drag me, reluctantly, but with  
Clandestine pleasure  
Towards the realized, paltry, but  
Very extant ouput that I here produced  
By the end of the day?
