Sometimes things are easy  
Sometimes things are hard  
Some things we keep close to us  
Others we discard  
Sometimes rain smells yummy  
Sometimes it smells gross  
Often we're reminded of  
The things that we kept close  
Some things can't be spoken  
Some things can't explain  
Sometimes we are crying tears  
Other times it's rain  
Sometimes we remember  
Sometimes we forget  
Often times the memories  
Don't make sense quite yet  
Some things blend together  
Some things stand apart  
Why oh why oh why must I  
Attend this broken heart  
Sometimes things are clever  
Sometimes things are trite  
Sometimes you are by yourself  
In deepest darkest night  
Sometimes it's a horror  
Sometimes it's a shame  
Sometimes you might ask yourself  
The reason for this pain  
Sometimes things are easy  
Sometimes things are hard  
Some things we hold up in scorn  
Some in high regard
