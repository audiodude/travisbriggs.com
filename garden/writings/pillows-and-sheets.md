I'm feeling sour  
I haven't got the power  
To get out of my bed today  
Alone and anxious  
I haven't got the patience  
To go and face that dread today  
Close my eyes  
Cannot rest  
Feel the pain  
In my chest  
I'm feeling lonely  
Anxiety's the only  
Friend that I will greet today  
With thoughts unruly  
Anxiety is truly  
Not one to be beat today  
Take a breath  
Can't relax  
Tons of fear  
Coming back  
I feel defeated  
Discouraged and retreated  
With thoughts heavily pounding  
The plan, it is resounding:  
I won't get out of bed today.
