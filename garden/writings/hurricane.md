What I really need is a pretty place to write poetry.  
A pretty place to place pretty poetry.  
A place that is full of empty space that  
longs to be filled with my words and  
especially the metaphors that are so elegantly  
constructed. Even if the line endings are somewhat  
haphazard and none of the lot rhymes in any  
considerable way, the point of the endeavor and  
its ultimate raisin de etre or whatever is that  
it brings my ideas and feelings into the world.  
My naked fleshy wet body of poetry bursts  
screaming into the world and now it's a tornado or  
really a combination tornado-hurricane like device that  
turns with glory and rips the tattered rooftop  
off my own inequities. There is nothing left of me  
in the wake of its great destruction, there are only  
the words.
