I think that everyone who publishes on the internet wants attention, but not too much attention. I've heard it said that Twitter gives everyone a chance to be the "main character" for the day, though as [[blog/mastodon-is-not-twitter|I've written]] it's not always a good thing when you are picked. I've also heard that Elon Musk's recent acquisition of Twitter was his attempt to make _himself_ the main character _every day_, but that's not particularly relevant to the current discussion.

While I feel somewhat distrustful of people who say things like "I'm only writing this for myself", or "This whole website is just for me", I appreciate the sentiment and it's definitely something I aspire to. I'd like to exist independently of any need for feedback or approval, though that's not really how the world works. Maybe once I get comments working and [[dg-feedback|can respond to feedback]] it will be more true that this garden exists for engagement and discussion, and not just to blast my ideas out into the world.
