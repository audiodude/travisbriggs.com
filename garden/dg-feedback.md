I have recently added comments to this garden. I think it's critical, given the fact that [[dg-evergreen|digital garden posts are unfinished, or evergreen]] and [[dg-public|digital gardens allow for learning in public]]. Since it's happening in public, comments should be made in public. And since the nodes are supposed to be evergreen, it's important that people can comment and point out things that have gotten out of date or that don't mesh well with local reality.

Of course this doesn't mean that people will actually leave comments (I've had them enabled for almost a month as of this writing and no one has left a single comment yet). But that's okay, because [[dg-solo|digital gardens don't need attention to thrive]].

You can read more about my [[comments|comments system]].
