I have had some different recording setups over the past 20+ years I've been making digital music, but all of them were based around recording instruments into a [DAW](https://www.avid.com/resource-center/what-is-a-daw). Currently my recording studio is in a corner of my kitchen and is based around a Windows 11 computer and digital composing/recording/editing in [[ableton-12|Ableton]]. Previously I used Ableton on a Mac, but I wasn't interested in buying Macs anymore since they switched to Apple Silicon. I've got a [Steinberg UR22](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UR22C--steinberg-ur22c-usb-audio-interface?cond=UR22CU1) audio interface that I plug guitar or a mic into, or sometimes both. I haven't recorded acoustic guitar in like 8 years, mostly I just do electric. I don't mic any amps, I always just use amp modelling plugins like [Amplitube](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5/?pkey=amplitube-5-max-v2) and [Guitar Rig](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/guitar/guitar-rig-7-pro/). I also own an electric bass that I can record using the same audio interface and plugins. And I have a couple of MIDI keyboards, including an [Akai MPK Mini](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MPKMiniPlus--akai-professional-mpk-mini-plus-37-key-keyboard-controller) which sits directly next to my computer chair.

It's a very sparse setup, but I like it because it mostly "stays out of my way".
