[Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/what-is-live/) is music production software that serves as a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). It allows musicians and producers to record and edit digital audio tracks, compose arrangements using looping and part triggering, and even perform DJ sets on the fly from within the interface.

I might have more to say on this subject in the future.
