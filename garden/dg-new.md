I'm definitely a person who has a preference for the "new and shiny". Out with the old, in with the new, I would agree. Sometimes this can be a bit of a liability, where I might pass over the "tried and true". But I think with Digital Gardens, we need to be ready to embrace new ways of thinking, new technologies for generating and maintaing websites (and [[gemini|Gemsites!]]), etc. It could be that a "Digital Garden" is just a reaction to the concept of "Blogging" and isn't particularly noteworthy of itself. Or it could be that digital gardening embraces the new and noteworthy and builds on the latest ideas in the space to create both artifacts and ways of thinking that are truly "new". I prefer the latter.
