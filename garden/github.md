I think [Github](https://github.com) is great, I love it. I feel like it keeps getting better and better. I like how all the "enterprise" features stay out of your way and are completely unnecessary if you're just a personal lone hacker working on your own and other's code. To be clear, I am not in any way opposed to using Github.

I find it interesting, however, that most of the open source, privacy thumping, anti-corporate, free software crusaders I know still use Github. Githubs hedgemony is so complete that it is still unexpected, for me, when I come across a repo that is hosted somewhere other than Github. For example, for my [[bandcamp|Bandcamp alternative site]], I'm using [Faircamp](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp) as a backend, which is hosted on something called "Codeberg". I've also seen people self host their repos using tools like [Gitea](https://gittea.dev/). I know that at least [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is somewhat popular. But still, day to day, as I find and read about and contribute to code, that code is on Github.

I also find it interesting that Github kind of made [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) the default [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). I mean, 20 years ago we definitely knew we could do better than [CVS](https://cvs.nongnu.org/), and there _was_ [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/). I even remember when there were Subversion <=> git import and compatibility layers. But with the popularity of Github, it seems that git just ate the world. [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) (hg) came out around the same time if I remember correctly, and offered a different opinion on how to have distributed source control in federated repos, but it didn't catch on the way git did. It's kind of like the killer app completely _made_ the tool. Sort of like [[Ruby on Rails]], where no one would have ever cared about the Ruby without the Rails.
