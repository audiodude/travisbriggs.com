Hi, I'm **Travis Briggs** and you've stumbled upon my digital garden. Welcome! If you're interested in what I'm thinking or working on, feel free to walk through the [[gate|garden gate]].

I'm trying to follow the [[digital-gardening-principles|principles of digital gardening]] here.

This garden is also available as a [[gemini|Gemini]] capsule at [gemini://gem.travisbriggs.com](gemini://gem.travisbriggs.com).

Comments are enabled by replying to a Mastodon post for each garden node.

The source code for this garden is [available](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com), and I'm tracking [issues to improve it](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues). It is based on [Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) which is based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Welcome!

[[gate|Garden Gate]]
