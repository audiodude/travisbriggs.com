Hi, I'm [Travis Briggs](https://travisbriggs.com) and you've stumbled upon my digital garden. Or maybe you were forced to come here by the various military robots I have deployed across the web, who knows. Either way, welcome! If you're interested in what I'm thinking or working on, feel free to walk through the [[gate|garden gate]], which is arranged kind of like a knowledge graph of pages or nodes. You should be able to use the backlinks to find other nodes that linked to the one you're reading.

I'm trying to follow the [[digital-gardening-principles|principles of digital gardening]] here. I intend to cast a wide net of potential topics, then I will hopefully link some of these concepts together and grow the garden over time.

This garden is also (finally!) available as a [[gemini|Gemini]] capsule at [gemini://gem.travisbriggs.com](gemini://gem.travisbriggs.com).

The source code for this garden is [available](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com), and I'm tracking [issues to improve it](https://github.com/audiodude/garden.travisbriggs.com/issues). It is based on [Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) which is based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Welcome!
