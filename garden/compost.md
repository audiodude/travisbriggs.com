I've struggled against [[dg-reverse|Reverse Chronological Order]], but I've still found myself replicating it in my collection of previously published [[blog|blog posts]] and even a new [[til|TIL]] section I created just for this site. Why, why must we repeat the mistakes of the past?

In the meantime, I've felt handcuffed from adding new content to this Garden. While I thought I would be writing a bunch of [[dg-evergreen|evergreen posts]], I ended up being shackled by the fact that when I had an idea of something to write about, I couldn't think of anywhere to link it from! So I had all these ideas for garden "nodes", but no "place in the garden" for them.

For this reason, I've created this "Compost pile". Maybe compost is a bad word, because it implies decay. On the other hand, it also implies new growth. The idea is to stick a bunch of random thoughts here, as a place to link my new nodes from. If they eventually grow into something greater, than I can hopefully "plant" them somewhere else in the garden. If not...well at least they're not in Reverse Chronological Order.

I'm surprised by how many people who I consider "open source advocates" and "free software crusaders" are [[github|still comfortable using Github]].

Speaking of GitHub, I've been [[codecov|fighting with Codecov for months]] (but may have finally won!).

At the beginning of 2023 I [[apache|wrote an email]] to the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) about the lack of inclusive language in their name.

On my [[comments-research|quest for comments]] I learned a [[activity-pub|bit about ActivityPub]].

Trying to organize my [[genre-thoughts|thoughts on genres]] and how they affect my music practice.
