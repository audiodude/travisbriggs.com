The main reference article I've been linking to is [Shawn Wang's "Learn In Public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). I'm hoping to be explosively productive in the amount of material I write and chronicle. I want to share every note and piece of feedback I receive as I build my personal ["Second Brain"](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/).

This sounds great in theory, but in practice it's a bit intimidating to put out your own personal opinions and understandings of a topic without knowing for certain that it's completely "settled". What if I change my mind? What if I realize that my nascent thoughts on a topic were wildly naive and unsophisticated.

There's some amount of fearlessness to be had with this one in order to do it properly.
