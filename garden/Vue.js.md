[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is an awesome frontend [[javascript-typescript|JavaScript/Typescript]] framework for making all kinds of interactive, reactive, web applications. One of the coolest things about it is that you can include just a snippet of JavaScript on a page and progressively enhance the page with interactive functionality, without commiting to the whole framework. On the other hand, you can easily write full fledged SPAs like I've done with [[wp-1.0|WP 1.0]] and [[Rainfall]].
