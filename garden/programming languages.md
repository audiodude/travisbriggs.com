I realize that I've written a lot about different programming languages that I'm familiar with in this digital garden. This node is sort of a meta node that serves to tie those pages together a bit.

Here is a list:

* [[Python]] - my current go to for pretty much everything. [[wp-1.0|My wikipedia bot]] was written in it. So was [[Rainfall]].
* [[javascript-typescript|JavaScript/TypeScript]] - This is what I mostly do at work now. And I use it for the web apps listed above. I love pairing it with the [[Vue.js]] framework for modern frontend applications.
* [[Ruby on Rails]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[Java]]
